# Proximal Policy Gradient Algorithms

## Students

Validation project (M2DS - Introduction to Reinforcement Learning):
- BISCARRAT Lilian
- CHAUSSARD Alexandre
- MORVAN Th√©o

## Description

This project consists in summarizing the paper on Proximal Policy Gradient Algorithms by Schulman et al. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf) 
as well as providing a PyTorch implementation for the following algorithms:
- PGO
- A2C
- TRPO
- PPO

The implementations are here to illustrate properties of each policy optimization algorithm, comparing them on various environments to verify the results of the original paper.

Our final report can be found on this GitHub if necessary.
